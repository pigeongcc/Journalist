A program for automatic counting of average marks in grades list of cadets. Grades list made by template is input and .docx file with the same list with counted avg marks put at proper places is output. May be launched both from IDE and with .exe, on a machine without any compilators or interpretators installed. Helped my friend-cadet a lot.
